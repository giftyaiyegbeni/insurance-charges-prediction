# insurance-charges-prediction
Utilized pandas to preprocess an insurance dataset and applied machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Decision Tree Regression to predict insurance charges.

In this project, an insurance dataset was processed using the Pandas library in Python. The dataset included various features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges. The goal was to predict insurance charges based on these features.

Three machine-learning models were employed for the prediction task: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Decision Tree Regression. Each model was evaluated using key metrics to assess their performance. 

In evaluating different regression models for predicting insurance charges, Linear Regression demonstrated moderate accuracy, explaining 78.3% of the variance in the data. Random Forest Regression exhibited superior performance, accurately explaining 86.5% of the variance, making it the most effective model. Decision Tree Regression, although effective, showed a slightly lower accuracy of 75.8%. These results underline the Random Forest model's ability to provide highly accurate predictions for insurance charges based on the given dataset.

The results highlighted that the Random Forest Regression model was the most accurate and reliable in predicting insurance charges, making it the preferred choice for this dataset. This analysis showcases the practical application of machine learning techniques in real-world scenarios, enabling accurate predictions and valuable insights for insurance charge estimation based on various factors.
